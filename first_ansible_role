ansible-galaxy role init my_first_role

*************************
2. Define Your Role
a. Add Tasks
Edit my_first_role/tasks/main.yml to define the tasks for your role. For example, letâ€™s create a role that installs nginx and ensures it's running:

---
- name: Install nginx
  apt:
    name: nginx
    state: present
  become: yes

- name: Ensure nginx is running and enabled
  systemd:
    name: nginx
    state: started
    enabled: yes
  become: yes
*************************
b. Set Default Variables
You can set default variables in my_first_role/defaults/main.yml. For instance:


---
nginx_package: nginx
nginx_service: nginx

*************************
c. Define Handlers
Handlers are used to handle changes that occur during the playbook execution. For example, you might want to restart nginx if the configuration changes. Edit my_first_role/handlers/main.yml:

---
- name: Restart nginx
  systemd:
    name: nginx
    state: restarted
  become: yes
*************************
Define Variables
If you have specific variables for the role, you can define them in my_first_role/vars/main.yml. For example:

---
server_name: example.com

************************


 Create a Playbook to Use Your Role
Create a playbook in your project directory that uses your new role. For example, create site.yml in the root of your project directory:

---
- name: Deploy nginx web server
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  roles:
    - my_first_role

*************************

 Create an Inventory File
Create an inventory file named inventory.ini (or inventory.yml if you prefer YAML format) to define the hosts:

[webservers]
localhost ansible_connection=local

************************
Run the Playbook
Run the playbook to apply the role:

ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini site.yml
